# 🐤 FlappyBird

## ♟ Context

Created in January 2019, FlappyBird is a repository that contains the copy of the original worldwide hit game, I made the copy while taking the Full Android Development Course, where I was taught the basics of the mobile world with the Java language.

## 💡 ideia

I Created an Android Java app that simulates the original FlappyBird game using the GDX library for android java. Where I learned how to consume the GDX library and generate animations with the touch screen, finally getting a game almost identical to the original game FlappyBird.

## 🔥 Technologies

- Java
- GDX lib
